# Cricket Match Analysis

In this repository, you'll find a Jupyter notebook where I perform a comprehensive analysis of a cricket match dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and more.

## Project Overview

I start the project by importing a cricket dataset and performing initial data cleaning and preprocessing. This includes operations like splitting columns, checking for null values, correcting data types, and renaming columns for better understanding and consistency.

Next, I create new features that could be useful for the analysis. These features capture additional information from the existing data and are designed to provide more insights during the analysis phase.

Then, I perform a series of analyses to understand the data better:

- **Descriptive Analysis:** I generate summary statistics, count values, check for missing values, and detect outliers.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset. I use various visualizations to aid in this understanding.

I also discuss various other analysis techniques such as trend analysis, comparative analysis, hypothesis testing, and factor analysis. However, not all of these techniques are applied in this project due to the nature of the dataset.

Throughout the project, I explain each step and its purpose in detail. After each analysis or visualization, I add markdown cells to explain the insights I gained from them.
